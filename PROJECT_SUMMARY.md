# Project Summary - pluga-command-system

## Current State

`pluga-command-system` is the repository for **"המפקד"**, a Hebrew RTL company command-management system.

The project currently uses:

- Next.js 16 App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Supabase Auth
- Supabase schema and seed files
- Next.js 16 `src/proxy.ts` for protected routes
- Existing `AppContext` / localStorage demo layer

The schema and seed were already run manually in Supabase. The seed file is kept in Git at `supabase/migrations/seed_units_roles.sql`.

## What Has Been Done

- Supabase client/server helpers are connected.
- Magic Link login UI and request flow exist.
- Auth callback route exists.
- Protected route proxy exists.
- Schema file exists.
- Units/roles seed file exists.
- The app has a protected layout with sidebar/mobile header.
- Core UI components exist: `GlassCard`, `GlossyButton`, `StatusBadge`, `EmptyState`.
- The current UI pass introduced the **Light Gloss Command System**.

## Latest Design Change

The design language was updated from dark/cyber styling to a bright professional command SaaS style:

- Light background: `#F6F7F9`
- Primary text: `#020108`
- Primary action: `#FF6B02`
- Soft glass cards with blur, light borders, and restrained shadows
- Orange active states
- RTL-friendly mobile-first forms

Screens aligned in this pass:

- `/login`
- `/onboarding`
- `/select-role`
- `/pending-approval`
- `/dashboard` placeholder
- Protected layout, sidebar, mobile header, and page header

## Auth Status

Supabase Magic Link is implemented but not fully verified end-to-end because Supabase currently returns:

```txt
429 over_email_send_rate_limit
```

After the rate limit expires, test:

- Magic Link email delivery
- `/auth/callback`
- `public.users` profile creation
- redirect to `/onboarding`
- redirect to `/pending-approval`
- approved user access to `/dashboard`

## Important Constraints

- Do not change schema, seed, auth callback, or proxy during design-only work.
- Do not delete `AppContext` / localStorage yet.
- Do not rename `proxy.ts` to `middleware.ts`.
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force`.
- Keep Hebrew RTL.
- Keep the primary design light. Do not return to dark theme.

## Next Step

Run visual QA and build checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit
npm run build
```

Then manually verify `/login`, `/onboarding`, `/select-role`, `/pending-approval`, and `/dashboard` on desktop and mobile width `390x844`.
